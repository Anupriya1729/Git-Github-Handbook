<h2>Why do we need Version Control?</h2>
<pre>
• Have you ever made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
• Have you ever had to maintain multiple versions of a product?
• Do you want to prove that a particular change broke or fixed a piece of code?
• Have you ever wanted to review the history of some code?
• Have you ever lost code or had a backup that was too old?
• Have you ever wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom?
• Have you ever wanted to submit a change to someone else's code?
• Have you ever wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code simultaneously?
• Have you ever wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code?
If you have experienced difficulties due to any of the above condition then that’s an indicator to use Version Control in your 
project.

<h2> What is a VCS or Version Control System?</h1>
<pre>
• VCS is a management software responsible for <b>managing the changes</b> in your project. 
• It allows you to track your files progress over time.
• In version control, you create safe points that save your project, giving you total freedom and security to change anything 
  about your project, and not worry about losing any of your data.
• The main point of a VCS is to help us maintain a detailed history of the project, and to work on different versions of it too.
• VCS is also know as Scource code manager (SCM).

<h2>VSC Allows:</h2>
<pre>
• Version tracking and branching
• Rollback to previous versions
• Tagging: A tag is just a snapshot of a project in time. You can tag to refer it back later whenever required
• Collaboration
• Inform us about who, what, when, why of the changes made

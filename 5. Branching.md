• The default branch is called master branch.
• Branching: Diverging from main branch.
• A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits.

A branch is created when you want to add something to your code base(a new feature) and see if it's working but you don't want the
main code to be affected.

<h2>Why branching is required?</h2>
<pre>
Branching is to maintain stability while isolated changes are made to code.
Branching facilitates the development of bug fixes, the addition of new capabilities and the integration of new versions after 
they have been tested in isolation.
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.

<h2>Creating a new branch</h2>
<pre>
(HEAD -> master) : The head pointer points at the most recent commit.

<b>git branch</b> : tells us all the branches in our project.
<b>git branch -v</b> : tells us the last commit in each branch.
<b>git branch branchname</b> : this is used to create a new branch.

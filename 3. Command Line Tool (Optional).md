There are two ways to interact with your computer: GUI and CLI
1. pwd    : print working directory -> This displays the directory in which git bash has been opened.
2. ls     : lists directory contents of files and directories
3. ls -l  : lists directories with more details
4. ls -a  : lists directories including hidden files and folders

/  -> root 
.  -> current directory
.. -> parent directory

5. clear            : clears the screen
6. cd foldername    : change directory to the specified folder, you can also nest folder cd folder1/folder2
7. cd ..            : this will make us return to the parent directory
8. cd or cd ~       : this will take you to the home directory

9.  mkdir foldername : this will make a new folder in the current directory
10. mkdir f1 f2 f3   : this will create 2 folders f1 f2 f3 at once in the same directory
11. mkdir -p f4/f5   : this will create a new folder f4 in the pwd and f5 will be created inside f4
12. mkdir f2/f6      : since f2 has already been created, so to create f6 inside f2 we use this

13. touch file.txt  : this will create a file inside pwd
14. touch script.js : this will create a js file
15. open script.js  : this will open the scripts file

16. rm filename            : deletes the file with given filename
17. rm foldername/filename : deletes given file in the specified folder
rm command is used to remove files 

18. rmdir foldername      : removes the given foldername
19. rm -R foldername      : this is used when your folder is not empty, R means recursively

20. cp f1.xyz foldername/f2.xyz : This will copy a file f1.xyz to f2.xyz inside specified folder (f2 may or maynot already exist)
    we can also give path to file f1 if it is in any other directory
21. cp -R folder1 folder2       :  this is used to copy entire folder

22. mv file.txt f1/file.txt     : this is used to cut file.txt and paste it to f1 with name file.txt
    mv f1.js f2.js              : cuts f1 from pwd and pastes it in the same place with name f2. It seems like rename.

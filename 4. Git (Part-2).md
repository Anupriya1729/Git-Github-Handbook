Three Stage Architecture:

<h2>Creating a Git repository</h2>
<pre>
1. git init
   The command is used to initialise a local repo as git repo. This will create hidden folder called '.git'. That's where git stores everything.
   Without the presence of .git folder the local repo is not considered as a git repo.

2. git status
   Used to obtain the current status of project. 
   It tells us in which branch we are and lists all files that you have changed or those you still need to add or commit.

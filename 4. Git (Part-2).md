Types of Git commands:
1. Creating Repository (Repository: A project or a folder)
2. Making Changes
3. Parallel Development
4. Syncing Repository

Three Stage Architecture:
Modified  Staged  Commited
Before 'commit' files are first brought to staging area and once the commit is done it get gets removed from Staging Area.
Commit in layman language means taking the snapshot.

<h2>Creating a Git repository</h2>
<pre>
1. git init
   The command is used to initialise a local repo as git repo. This will create hidden folder called '.git'. 
   That's where git stores everything. Without the presence of .git folder the local repo is not considered as a git repo.

2. git status
   Used to obtain the current status of project. 
   It tells us in which branch we are and lists all files that you have changed or those you still need to add or commit.
</pre>

<h2>Tracking your project</h2>
<pre>
<b>Tracking your files:</b> 
Each file in your working directory can be in any of the two states: tracked or untracked.
Tracked files are the files git knows about.
Untracked file is one which was not there in your last snapshot and is not in your staging area.
We need to add these files to staging area, then only git will understand that it has to track it.
To add files to staging are:<br><br>3. git add <filename>  #for one file
   git add .           #to add all files and folders

    This will stage the latest version of the file.
    After the files are in the staging area, we need to commit.

<b>Commiting changes:</b>
Moving your files from staging area to git folder is called a commit.
Making commits creates a version/snapshot of your project. <br><br>4. git commit -m "Your commit message"
      (-m is a flag which stands for message)
      This command is used to commit. It moves the files from staging area to the commmit area.
</pre>
<h2>Lifecycle of the Status of a file</h2>

</p>
</pre>

<h2>Viewing the commit history</h2>
<pre>
You can see all the commits/versions of your project.
5. git log    
   git log --oneline  (This will give you less details)
</pre>
<h2>Delete a Git Repo</h2>
<pre>
rm -rf .git
This command will recursively and forcefully delete the .git folder. Hence, all the versions/commits etc will be gone.
</pre>
<pre>
- for the initial commit you cannot skip the staging area
- but for the time when you are not creating any new file, you can skip the staging area.
6. git commit -a -m "message"
   This command is used to commit by skipping the staging area.

<b>Git diff</b>
This is used when you want to know exactly what you have changed instead of names of the files that are changed.
7. git diff
   Gives difference between files in working directory and the files in the staged area.
   
<b>Git ignore</b>
Many times there are files that we do not want git to track some autogenerated files like logs, nodemodule files or build files etc
To avoid them we can mention the name of those files or pattern of files in <b>.gitignore</b> file
.gitignore is a hidden .txt file which can be created using the CLI command "touch .gitignore"

We can also use REGEX in this file.
For example if we want to ignore all the files which end with .log
Then we can write "*.log" in the .gitignore file.

To ignore a complete folder named abc
Add "abc/" to gitignore file.

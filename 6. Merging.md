To merge any branch to the master branch we need to:
1. checkout to the master branch: "git checkout master"
2. <b>git merge branch1</b> - This will merge the branch1 with the master branch.
<br>
There are different types of merging.
<b>Fast-forward</b>: This type of merge happens when there are no changes in the master branch and we just need to 
add the changes of some branch to master. This is the most simple type of merge.

To skip when there are many lines coming on git bash, write:
Press esc then type, ":WQ"

<b>Recursive merge</b>: This happens when master branch has some changes after the new branch was created.
In this case the git goes to the least common ancestor and starts merging recursively.

Merge commit: Merge commits are unique against other commits in the fact that they have two parent commits. 
When creating a merge commit Git will attempt to auto magically merge the separate histories for you.

<h2>Merge Conflict</h2>
<pre>
Version control systems are all about managing contributions between multiple distributed authors ( usually developers ). 
Sometimes multiple developers may try to edit the same content.
Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, 
or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it. 
In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. 
Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict. 
Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process. 
It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.
</pre>

<h2>Resolving merge conflicts</h2>
<pre>
We need to manually go to the branch and either accept or remove incoming changes.
Commit the changes
Now merge the 2 branches causing issue.
<pre>
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later
</pre>Think of these new lines as "conflict dividers". 
The ======= line is the "center" of the conflict. 
All the content between the center and the <<<<<<< HEAD line is content that exists in the current branch main which the HEAD 
ref is pointing to. 
Alternatively all content between the center and >>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later is content that is present in our merging branch.

The most direct way to resolve a merge conflict is to edit the conflicted file. 
Open the merge.txt file in your favorite editor. Simply remove all the conflict dividers.
